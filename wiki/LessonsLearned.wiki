#summary What was learned from feedback from the supervisors and second reader

The following is a list of some of the things we took away from the project through feedback:

  * Presentation should have been on creating a better user experience (Our contribution) as a sales point

  * More about integration than creating something from scratch 

  * More information about the technical side of the project

  * Explanation about how it could be beneficial as open source
